This script takes an input CSV such as

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G87sfj3088CYs-ziHVHOkfryWg-MkkjWHy5dQ2cjBec/edit#gid=552474195

And outputs one with each row representing either "Paged Content" or a "Page" of the Paged Content. It expands each row according to its "Associated Image #s" in the input CSV.

The output CSV can then be used to ingest the paged content into Islandora.
